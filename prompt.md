Project: React Contact List Application

Objective

Build a single-page web application (SPA) using React that functions as a simplified contact list. The goal is to assess frontend development skills, React knowledge, API interaction, component design, and product sense.

Core Features

View Contact List: Display a list of contacts.

Search Contacts: Implement a search bar that filters the contact list by name as the user types.

Add New Contact (Optional): Include functionality to add a new contact to the list.

Technical Requirements

Framework: You must use React.

Libraries: You are free to use any auxiliary libraries or meta-frameworks (e.g., Next.js, Vite, Create React App, Tailwind CSS, etc.) as you see fit.

API Interaction:

You can mock the data fetching from an API or hardcode the initial contact list data within the UI.

If mocking, simulate API states (loading, success, error).

Environment: The application must run in a modern web browser.

Design Guidance

You have creative freedom on the UI/UX design.

This is an opportunity to demonstrate your UX design skills.

The final design should be user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

Handle all relevant states, such as loading states, empty states (no contacts found), and error states.

Project Structure & Submission

Please generate the following:

Source Code:

Create all necessary React components (e.g., App, ContactList, ContactItem, SearchBar, AddContactForm).

Ensure the code is clean, well-commented, and follows React best practices.

README.md File:

Generate a README.md file that includes:

Instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.

A link to the (hypothetical) deployed application.

A section on "Assumptions & Design Choices" to highlight any decisions made (e.g., UI interactions, error handling, data structure).

A brief note on any libraries used and the reason for choosing them.

Final Output

Provide the complete source code for the React application and the content for the README.md file, all structured for a functional project.
