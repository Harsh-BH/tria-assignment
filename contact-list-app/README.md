## 🎨 Design Choices & Assumptions

### UI/UX Decisions

1. **Glass Morphism Design**: Used glass effects with backdrop blur for a modern, premium feel
2. **Gradient Backgrounds**: Subtle gradients create visual depth and interest
3. **Card-based Layout**: Each contact is displayed in a card for better organization
4. **Hover Animations**: Subtle scale and shadow effects on hover for better interactivity
5. **Color Scheme**: Blue to purple gradient theme for a professional yet friendly appearance

### Technical Decisions

1. **Component Architecture**: 
   - Separated concerns with individual components for each feature
   - Reusable components for different states (loading, error, empty)
   - Props-based communication between components

2. **State Management**:
   - Used React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state
   - Simulated API calls with loading states and error handling
   - Optimistic updates for better user experience

3. **Animation Strategy**:
   - Framer Motion for complex animations and transitions
   - CSS transitions for simple hover effects
   - Staggered animations for list items
   - Layout animations for smooth reordering

4. **Form Validation**:
   - Client-side validation with real-time feedback
   - Visual error states with color coding
   - Required field validation with helpful error messages

### Data Structure

```javascript
const contact = {
  id: number,           // Unique identifier
  name: string,         // Full name
  email: string,        // Email address
  phone: string,        // Phone number
  avatar: string        // Profile image URL
}
```

### API Simulation

- **Loading States**: 1.5 second delay to simulate network latency
- **Error Handling**: 10% chance of simulated API failure
- **Mock Data**: Pre-populated with 5 sample contacts
- **Avatar Fallback**: Uses UI Avatars service for missing images
